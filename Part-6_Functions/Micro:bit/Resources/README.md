# Activity Worksheet: Functions
## Introduction
In this project activity you will learn how to create and use functions with micro:bit. You will learn why functions are useful, and how to use them together with your previous knowledge.
This time, please read the instructions carefully, as you will not be shown where the different blocks are lockated, but the instructions will tell you this information.

## Part 1: Basic Function
Lets begin the activity with an introductory function:

- [ ] Open up a browser and go **[https://makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org)**
- [ ] Start a new empty project by clicking on the **Project Menu** and select the **New Project** menu button in the pop-up screen, as you have done in previous lessons
- [ ] Go to **Advanced** and click on **Functions**
- [ ] Click on **Make a function** and here you give it the name **Hello**

</p>

- [ ] Our function will display a message, I have chosen "Hi Kids!" but you can choose whatever you would like
- [ ] To get the **show string** block go to Basic menu and drag it inside the function
- [ ] To get the **message** with the string go to Advanced then go to Text menu and drag the box with quotations

</p>

- [ ] To see anything, we now need to call our function
- [ ] From Input menu drag the On Button A pressed block
- [ ] Go to Advanced and from Functions drag the Call function Hello block as seen bellow

</p>

## Part 2: Function with and variables
In this part we introduce a new type of function: a function which makes use of a variable, and it will change the value of the variable each time it is called.

- [ ] Go to Advanced and from Functions create a new function, let's name it CountMyFruit(fruit)
- [ ] We calculate the total number of fruit by adding how many fruit we previously had with the total number of pears and apples, so each time we call this function our total number of fruit will increase
