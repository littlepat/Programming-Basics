# Activity Worksheet: Loops

## Introduction
In this project activity you will learn to create and access lists with the micro:bit. This will build upon your pervious skills you have learnt from the previous project activites such as variables, loops and conditional statements.

## Part 1: Basics Lists
Lets begin the activity by trying out some simple items in a list like we did in the starter exercise.

- [ ] Open up a browser and go to **[https://makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org)**.
- [ ] Start a new empty project by clicking on the **projects menu** and select the **New Project** menu button in the pop-up screen, this only needs to be done if there is still old code on the sandbox from your previous work.
