# Start Activites: Lists

## Activity 1
#### Brief:
Understandng a List

#### Activity:
Requirements: 6 pieces of paper per group with the numbers 1 to 6 written on them (one number per sheet).

Break into groups of roughly 7. Tell each pupil from left to right that they are number 1 to 6. Hand each of them their respective sheet of paper.

Ask the 7th pupil to identify which pupil has number 4. Then another few numbers to check. They should repeat back the 4th for 4, 5th for 5th and so on.

Explain that this is a list of numbers. The list has places, or indexes, so the first place is 0, the second is 1, the third is 2 and so on. Explain that in coding you start from 0. 

Now change the order of the pupils and have them turn thier paper around. Assign numbers to the pupils again so the left hand side is 1, second in is 2 and so on. Now ask the 7th pupil where the sheet with number 3 is. It is unlikely this will be at the number 3 pupil. Let them ask to see each piece of paper one piece at a time until they figure it out. Ask them to do this methodically - left to right. Then mix up the line and re-perform the same exercise. 

Explain that information may be stored in a list to allow searches like this to be carried out - to find out what values are present and where they are.

#### Understanding Questions:
Question to ask at the end of the starter activity to gain understanding:
* What is a list?

#### Outcome:
By the end of the starter activity, the pupil should be able to explain a list. Essentially it is:
* A set of variables
* Stored in an organised manner
* Accessible via the index or place in the list
* That can be acted on and sorted through
